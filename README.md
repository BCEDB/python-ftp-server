# python-ftp-server

To run the Python FTP Server you **may** need to install the pyftpdlib dependency and ensure the script is run as a user with permission to write to the Windows C:/ drive. This being said the Python script will attempt to install pyftpdlib if the dependency does not already exist.
```
pip install pyftpdlib
```
